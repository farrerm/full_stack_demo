At the time of submission, all code is working correctly and satisfies project requirements 100 percent.

Since I am short on time, I will focus on providing a verbal description of the project, and the design decisions I made.

All code is under the master folder cdk_nu.

The frontend code is in cdk_nu/frontend.  It includes form that allows text and file submission.  It is running ReactJS.
